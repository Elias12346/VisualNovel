*Start of 02_Act2Scene1*

The meeting place is bunch of tents with a fireplace in the center with tables and chairs surrounding it.
You notice John is already there, they seem to be discussing something important. You walk over to them and listen to the conversation.

@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
John is standing in front of the table, surrounded by what seems to be other members of his expedition. The table is covered by huge map, which has been rolled over the table with annotations all over it.
JohnMaxwell: Allright team! We have some info on a big find. An intact ancient lab of some sorts at these coordinates.
John is pointing at a specific spot on the map, and the rest of the team is listening intently.

@char JaneHolifield.Default pose:DefaultRight
You notice Jane is actually smiling, with rest of the team looking quite excited.

JohnMaxwell: However, there is a problem. It's located in the Earthflame territory.
You notice the mood in the camp turns tense, with low murmurs and worried looks exchanged between the team members.

@hide JohnMaxwell
Earthflame? You have no idea who or what that is. You decide to ask John about it.

@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
TheContractor: Who's this Earthflame?
JohnMaxwell: I guess you really have lost your memory, huh? They are one of the richest families here on Earth.
JohnMaxwell: They have vested interest in the mining operations on Earth.
JohnMaxwell: And uuh... We might have some bad blood between us. We "might" have stolen some plans from them a decade ago.

@char TarosJones.Default pose:DefaultRight
TarosJones: Hah! I still remember that gig. What an explosive way to start my career!
Taros exclaims with a smile on his face.

@char KatieMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultRight
KatieMaxwell: You both are lucky to have survived that operation.
Katie is holding his hand against his forehead, as if trying to suppress a headache.

TheContractor: So, basically a rival group with a disdain for us. Got it.

@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultLeft
@char KatieMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultRight
You notice Katie is the first to speak up, she seems to be deep in thought, looking at the map with fingers on her chin.
KatieMaxwell: In Earthflame territory... Could this be a trap?
JohnMaxwell: Could be, you never know with these types.
JohnMaxwell: But even if it is, we still need to take that chance. We have some debts to pay, and this lab might just save us.
KatieMaxwell: I agree. We can't afford to miss this opportunity.

@hide KatieMaxwell
@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
JohnMaxwell: Alright, any questions?
John looks around the table, making sure everyone is on the same page.
JohnMaxwell: Okay, time to roll out then. Katie, Taros, Contractor, and Jane, you're with me.
John looks at direction of a group of four people.
JohnMaxwell: Ulysses, you're on escort duty. Take your team and stay on watch.
You notice John is locking his eyes with Ulysses's.
JohnMaxwell: If something happens, you know what to do.
Ulysses nods in agreement.
Ulysses: Got it, boss.

@hide JohnMaxwell
Ulysses and his team walk away from the camp, heading towards what seems to be the garage.

@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
John turns towards all of you, gesturing to follow him.
JohnMaxwell: Alright, people. You all know your jobs. Start preparations for the departure.
You nod in agreement and start following John.

@hide JohnMaxwell
You follow John to the garage, where you see a big wheeled vehicle that looks like a truck. It's old and weathered, but still strong and stable.
You notice Ulysses and his team are already there, they are preparing for departure as well. They are loading their gear into the separate vehicle from yours.

@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultLeft
@char JaneHolifield.Default pose:DefaultRight
Just as you wonder what to do, John looks at you and gestures towards both you and Jane to climb aboard the truck.

@hide JaneHolifield
@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
As you sit inside the truck, you notice John is preparing to start the engine and shouts out to the rest of the team.
JohnMaxwell: We're going with light gear, so make sure you only take what you need. We don't know what we'll find there.
John turns the key and the truck roars to life, and you feel the vibrations under your feet along with the sound of humming engine.

@hide JohnMaxwell
@char KatieMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultLeft
@char TarosJones.Default pose:DefaultRight
You notice Katie and Taros outside the truck's windows, loading the gear into the truck. You note the precision and silent efficiency with which they work.
Even Taros seems to be focused on the task at hand, without his usual banter.

@hide TarosJones
@hide KatieMaxwell

You watch both of them work, and you can't help but feel a sense of unease creeping up on you. You try to shake it off, but the feeling lingers in the back of your mind.
The silence is broken by both Katie and Taros opening the doors and climbing into the truck, taking their seats without a word.
@char JohnMaxwell.Default pose:DefaultMiddle
JohnMaxwell: Alright, ya all ready? Let's move out!
John steps on the accelerator, and the truck starts moving. You leave the camp behind, heading towards the unknown.

Comment Section:

From now on I'll add comment sections like this at the end of the naninovel scripts to explain the changes I made to the original script when compared to the naninovel script.
I'll also add some questions and notes I have about dialogue here, as I am making those changes. Hopefully it will help you understand my thought process and give basis on why I made those changes.

Original Script:

-You are walking to the meeting place with John and the rest of the team.
EDIT: Since this scene starts right after the last one, I decided to remove the "You are" part from the beginning of the sentence. It's not necessary to repeat the same information again.

-The meeting place is a bunch of tents with a fireplace in the center with tables and chairs surrounding it.
JOHN: Allright team we got some info on a big find. An intact ancient lab of some sorts.
-The team seems to become quite excited especially Jane who is actually smiling.
JOHN: There still is a problem, it’s Earthflame territory.
(Comment mainly for phuc here changed the name from motherflame to something else with a flame name in it as personally motherflame sounds stupid)(Also if it is okay to make something completely not related to flame then some normal surname/company name is also good)
-Instantly the mood in the camp turns tense. Jane still seems to be too much in her head to listen.
-You decide to ask about this Earthflame as you have no idea why everyone is distressed
MC: Who’s this Earthflame.
JOHN: I guess you really lost your memory huh. They are one of the richest families mining here on Earth.
EDIT: Small changes to dialogue and flow of the conversation, to make it more concise and to the point and to make it sound more natural.

JOHN: We also miiight have stolen some plans from them a decade ago.
TAROS: Heh, remember that job still. What a way to start my career.
EDIT: Added Katie to the mix, because why not. :D
There's good opportunity for dynamic conversation between the characters here.

MC: So basically, a rival group with a disdain for us. Wouldn’t it mean this is a trap.
EDIT: First "questionable" change. I don't think the MC would be so quick to jump to the conclusion that it's a trap.
It's a bit too much of a leap in logic, based on the information available. He doesn't yet know anything that the "rival" and it's his first time hearing about it, so I changed the line to reflect that.
I think Katie should say/insinuate that, since she seems to be the most cautious one in the group. It fits her character better.

KATIE: Maybe so, but we need to take that chance we got some debts to pay, and this lab might just save us.
EDIT: Shouldn't John say this? He's the leader of the group and it's his decision to make. I think it would make more sense for him to say this line.
Changed dialogue to reflect that and give John an excuse to say that line.

JOHN: She is right so time to roll. Katie, Taros, contractor and Jane with me.
-John points at a group of 4 people who you think you saw with Taros when you met him.
JOHN: Ulysses take your team and stay on watch if somethin’ happens.
-The 4 people led by Ulysses walk away from the camp towards what you assume is a garage.
EDIT: Every briefing or meeting by a responsible leader is always followed by "Any questions?" line, so I added that to make it more realistic and changed dialogue to reflect that.
Also, I added Ulysses and his team to the mix, gave them some dialogue to make it feel like the rest of the Maxwell team is also doing something, not just the main characters.
Could probably have a "neutral character" silhuette for characters like this. They are not important to the story, but they are still there. I'll look into it.

JOHN: Okay people time to move ya all know your jobs.
-You follow John to a separate garage from Ulysses people.
-In the garage you see a big wheeled vehicle that kind of looks like a truck. It looks quite old and weathered but still looks strong and stable.
-You and the rest of the team climb aboard in focused silence.
-You have a bad feeling about the coming mission but you try to stay positive.
(One important thing I want to ask is that is adding Ulysses or more like is naming a character at this point bad. I don’t plan on making him an actual character but still wanted to make it feel like the rest of the maxwell team is also doing something so added Ulysses and his team as some sort of guards or something.)
EDIT: Added more context to the scene, to make it more immersive and to give the player a better idea of what's happening around them, as they are leaving the camp.
